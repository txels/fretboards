    <h1>Introduction to 4ths tuning</h1>
    <p>
      4ths tuning is based on making all strings tuned one just 4th apart. This
      has the advantage (over the standard guitar tuning) that every fingering
      (provided no open strings are involved) is moveable across the fretboard,
      so your learning of fingerings is minimised.
    </p>

    <h2>Major scales</h2>
    <p>
      As an example, this is what a G major scale looks like on a guitar tuned
      in E 4ths (the root notes, G, are red). Note the symmetry of the patterns
      repeating all over the fingerboard:
    </p>
    <div class="fb-container" data-notes="g major"></div>
    <p>
      Notice how e.g. starting from any of the G notes with a given finger, you
      can play the exact same fingering pattern starting from different frets
      and different strings. If you have already been playing guitar for a
      while, you will realise how much simpler this is to memorise than with
      standard guitar tuning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at this basic layout for one octave of G major, if you start from
      your first finger:
    </p>
    <div
      class="fb-container"
      data-notes="6:g2 6:a2 6:b2 5:c3 5:d3 5:e3 4:f#3; 4:g3"
    ></div>
    <p>
      Starting from your second finger:
    </p>
    <div
      class="fb-container"
      data-notes="6:g2 6:a2 5:b2 5:c3 5:d3 4:e3 4:f#3; 4:g3"
    ></div>
    <p>
      Starting from your fourth finger:
    </p>
    <div
      class="fb-container"
      data-notes="4:g3 3:a3 3:b3 3:c4 2:d4 2:e4 2:f#4; 1:g4"
    ></div>
    <p>
      All of the notes of the G major scale based on a fixed position starting
      on the 3rd fret, which you can view as chaining the former fingerings:
    </p>
    <div
      class="fb-container"
      data-notes="6:g2 6:a2 6:b2 5:c3 5:d3 5:e3 4:f#3; 4:g3 4:a3 3:b3 3:c4 3:d4 2:e4 2:f#4; 2:g4 1:a4 1:b4 1:c5"
    ></div>
    <p>
      Similarly, but based on the 2nd fret:
    </p>
    <div
      class="fb-container"
      data-notes="6:g2 6:f#2 6:a2 5:b2 5:c3 5:d3 4:e3 4:f#3; 4:g3 3:a3 3:b3 3:c4 2:d4 2:e4 2:f#4; 1:g4 1:a4 1:b4"
    ></div>
    <p>
      One of the things you may have started to notice is that all scales that
      derive from a major scale can be comfortably played using 3 notes per
      string.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a final example, this is C Major all over the first twelve frets:
    </p>
    <div class="fb-container" data-frets="12" data-notes="c major"></div>

    <div class="fb-container" data-frets="6-12" data-notes="c major"></div>

    <script>
      Fretboard.drawAll(".fb-container", {
        tuning: Tunings.guitar6.E_4ths,
        leftHanded: true,
      });
    </script>
  </body>
